# intermediate_python
Collection of notebooks for intermediate python course


Potential schedule:

Week 1: environments, packages, look at some data using numpy as an introduction to an easy package to use  
Week 2: deep-dive into pandas as a very useful package (e.g. parts 1-7 of https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook)  
Week 3: matplotlib and seaborn - creating publication standard figures (different types of plots, colour schemes, subplots, exporting)  
Week 4: moving to VScode - could just write a script with __main__ to start with, then move to command line if we have time. Also look at debugging.  
Week 5: OOP - classes, methods etc.  
Week 6-8: mini ML project  
  Week 6: lots of theory of an ML pipeline, terminology etc. (visualisation, messy data, normalisation, imputation, train/test split, cross validation, different evaluation methods)  
  Week 7: build an ML pipeline and implement simple models using sklearn (e.g logistic regression, random forest)  
  Week 8: NN from scratch   
  
  
  
Technical Notes
  
  * We will start in jupyter notebooks run in colab instances, however we will transfer over to working on local machines in week 4 when we start writing standalone python scripts.  For this you will need to install both python3.9 and pycharm community edition from the AZ software store.  Prior to the fourth session, we will release some more detailed instructions for getting set up to use Python on your own machines (primarily so you are in a position to work with your own data), and will run a drop in session to iron out any technical issues you might encounter.
